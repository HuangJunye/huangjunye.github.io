NUS QEP Qiskit Workshop (May 18-20) - Together with National University of Singapore Quantum Engineering Programme, IBM Singapore hosted a very successful 3-day online hands-on quantum workshop with Qiskit. Over 100 participants attended the workshop, from local universities, research institutes and private industries with diverse expertises. Workshop schedule of materials can be found in this GitHub repository.


Singapore American School Science Club Outreach (May 15) - After my SGInnovate talk on April 28, a high school student Harsha Polavaram reached out to me for an online outreach with the members of Science Club of Singapore American School where he is the president. We had a 2-hour online interaction where I showed quantum circuits escape rooms in Qiskit Blocks and Q&amp;A with the students. I was genuinely surprised by the level of understanding and the questions raised by these high school students."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://huangjunye.github.io/events/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://huangjunye.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://huangjunye.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://huangjunye.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://huangjunye.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://huangjunye.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://huangjunye.github.io/events/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://huangjunye.github.io/events/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Junye Huang"><meta property="og:title" content="Events & Talks"><meta property="og:description" content="2020 May NUS QEP Qiskit Workshop (May 18-20) - Together with National University of Singapore Quantum Engineering Programme, IBM Singapore hosted a very successful 3-day online hands-on quantum workshop with Qiskit.

(slides)\nIBM Quantum Challenge (May 4-8) - To celebrate fourth anniversary of IBM Quantum Experience, IBM Quatnum team hosted an online quantum prgramming challenge. We had close to 2000 participants from 45 different countries. During the 96 hours of the Challenge, the total use of the 18 IBM Quantum systems on the IBM Cloud exceeded 1 billion circuits a day!\nApril Quantum Computing Now Podcast interview (Apr 30) - With this interview, I now enter the “Quantum Hall of Fame”, in the same rank as Abe Asfaw, Robert Sutor, Amira Abbas and James Wootton! Just kidding :) Please let me know what you think about the episode. I have no idea if it was a disaster because I can’t stand listenning to myself talking.\nLet’s Play Quantum Games (Apr 28) - A fun talk about quantum games together with Piotr Migdał, in collaboration with SGInnovate and CQT-NUS. Piotr and I got to know each other when he was invited to CQT to lead team to work on the sequal of his famous Quantum Game with Photons. (slides, video)\nIBM Garage Fast Start AP eConference (Apr 28) - Qiskit intro demo for an IBM internal event. (slides, video)\nIBM Quantum Pitch Contest (Apr 24) - A pitch contest for near term applications development using quantum systems that are available on IBM Quantum Experience. Three winning teams were chosen by the judging panel: Mr. George Loh, Director of NRF, Dr. Joe Fitzsimon, CEO of Horizon Quantum Computing, Dr. Ewan Munro, CTO of Entropica Labs and myself. The results were announced on Business Times, inside “Quantum key to future” box at the end of the article.\nIndiQ Quantum Game Jam (Apr 18-21) - This jam was hosted in parallel to Ludum Dare 46 jam (LDJAM46), one of the largest online game jam in the world.. There is only one additional restriction: your games must run on a quantum computer or a quantum simulator. Despite having short marketing period, we received 5 submissions and 29 ratings for the jam. The entry ratings were open to the public. My wife and I teamed up and made “Keep Drogon Alive”, a GoT themed, inverse space invaer, Ikaruga clone. You can play “Keep Drogon Alive” here.\nQiskit Workshop for CS4268 @ NUS (Apr 14) - Conducted online Qiskit workshop for NUS CS4268 course in School of Computing taught by Prof Rahul Jain. The workshop covered introduction to Qiskit and IBM Quantum experience, quantum teleportation and Grover’s algorithm chapters on Qiskit textbook. Together with Prof Rahul’s teaching assistant, we designed two Qiskit notebook assignment.\nFebruary IndiQ Meetups @ Hyderabad \u0026 Delhi (Feb 2) - My first talk in superposition! The talk happened in Hyderabad and Delhi at the same time (via conference call, of course). I shared my personal journey with Qiskit (slides, video) as well as an updated talk on how to make games with Qiskit (slides, video). 2019 November Qiskit Advocate Online Demo (Nov 7) - I shared my experience of organizing the first university Qiskit hackathon (Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore) with fellow Qiskit advocates (slides, video). October Quantum Future Hackathon (Oct 18-20)\nI was invited by the organizer Oday Darwich participate in this hackathon at CERN. As a physicist (self-proclaimed), visiting CERN is a dream come true. I visited the CMS detector where the Higgs boson was discovered! In this hackathon, I stepped out of my comfort zone (as you can tell from my blog posts, I am terrible at writing) and made a quantum story telling game: Woliverse. You can play it here. After the hackathon, I followed Jack Hidary, Director of AI and Quantum at Alphabet X to visit EPFL, ETH Zurich and Google Zurich. I also visited IBM Research Zurich thanks to James Wootton’s invitation. Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore (Oct 11-12)\nThis was the first ever university Qiskit hackathon in the world! I organized it together with Anurag Saha Roy and Evon Tan from Centre for Quantum Technologies. It was the debut of my public speaking career! I gave an introduction to how to make games with Qiskit (slides) at Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore. I wrote an article about the journey of organizing the hackathon. February Qiskit Camp 2019 (Feb 26 - Mar 1) - This was the beginning of my new career and birth of QPong.
