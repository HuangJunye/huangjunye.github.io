&lt;p>When I decided to write this series, I didn't think for a second to put Chen-Ning Yang in the first post for a few reasons. First, he probably got the Nobel prize (in 1957) earlier than anyone alive (except, of course, Tsung-Dao Lee, who shared the Nobel prize with CN Yang). Indeed, he was among the youngest to got the prize (at 35, only 16 laureates were younger at the time of award) and he is 93 years old already. Second, he was the first Chinese Nobel laureate (again, same for Tsung-Dao Lee). Third, CN Yang has made the biggest contributions to physics among all Chinese. He is considered the "best" Chinese physicist of all time. Of course, the last reason is that I have met him in person, but notÂ Tsung-Dao Lee, which is the criteria of this post series.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
