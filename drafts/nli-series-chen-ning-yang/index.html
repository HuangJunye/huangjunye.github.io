When I decided to write this series, I didn&#39;t think for a second to put Chen-Ning Yang in the first post for a few reasons. First, he probably got the Nobel prize (in 1957) earlier than anyone alive (except, of course, Tsung-Dao Lee, who shared the Nobel prize with CN Yang). Indeed, he was among the youngest to got the prize (at 35, only 16 laureates were younger at the time of award) and he is 93 years old already. Second, he was the first Chinese Nobel laureate (again, same for Tsung-Dao Lee). Third, CN Yang has made the biggest contributions to physics among all Chinese. He is considered the "best" Chinese physicist of all time. Of course, the last reason is that I have met him in person, but not Tsung-Dao Lee, which is the criteria of this post series.'><meta name=author content="map[display_name:Huang Junye email:h.jun.ye@gmail.com first_name: last_name: login:hjunye]"><link rel=canonical href=https://huangjunye.github.io/drafts/nli-series-chen-ning-yang/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://huangjunye.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://huangjunye.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://huangjunye.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://huangjunye.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://huangjunye.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://huangjunye.github.io/drafts/nli-series-chen-ning-yang/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://huangjunye.github.io/drafts/nli-series-chen-ning-yang/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Junye Huang"><meta property="og:title" content="NLI Series: Chen-Ning Yang"><meta property="og:description" content='This is the first post of the Nobel Laureates Impressions series.

Since primary school, I got to know that he is the first Chinese to be awarded Nobel prize. But not until I read his biography, did I realise how important he is to modern physics. There is a good summary of his works (13 problems in 4 fields) by Fudan University professor Shi Yu, published on a Chinese journal Physics. I quote it here:\n(A) Statistical Mechanics\nA1. 1952 Phase Transition\nA2. 1957 Bosons\nA3. 1967 Yang—Baxter Equation\nA4. 1969 Finite Temperature\n(B) Condensed Matter Physics\nB1. 1961 Flux Quantization\nB2. 1962 ODLRO\n(C) Particle Physics\nC1. 1956 Parity Nonconservation\nC2. 1957 T, C and P\nC3. 1960 Neutrino Experiment\nC4. 1964 CP Nonconservation\n(D) Field Theory\nD1. 1954 Gauge Theory\nD2. 1974 Integral Formalism\nD3. 1975 Fibre Bundle\nThe contributions were also engraved in the black marble cube given to CN Yang by Tsinghua University in his 90th birthday.\nHowever, despite the fact that he is one of the most important physicist alive, most Chinese got to know him because of his young wife, not because of his contributions to physics. If you search Yang's name in Chinese, the top results are almost exclusively about his wife. 老牛吃嫩草 (lao niu chi nen cao, old cow eats young grass) is the world they use to describe Yang's second marriage. They can't believe that a young and beautiful girl can fall in love with an old man more than 80 years old. \"She loves the fame and money of Yang only, not Yang himself.\" they think.\nMany Chinese also complained that Yang didn't come back to \"serve\" the country when the country needed him the most and only came back after 2000 when China already became one of the strongest economy in the world. There are also numerous articles talking about this. Yang is often compared with Qian Xuesen, who came back to China to develop rocket and missiles after becoming a professor in the US, and Deng Jiaxian, who was a childhood friend of Yang and also went to US to study and later came back to China to develop China's first atomic bomb. \"Science has no boundaries, but scientists have nationality\" (科学无国界，可是科学家有国籍) is topic that worth to write a post itself. I am not trying to argue about it here.\nLet's come back to the meat of the post: my personal impression of CN Yang.
